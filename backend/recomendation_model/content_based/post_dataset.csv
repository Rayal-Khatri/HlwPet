16,62,hello-pet,448,aaron94,2024-02-29 17:01:47.086217+00:00,The dog parks are doubling,"My city tried out a new off-leash dog park for several months in 2023. During and after the trial period, they invited people to fill out a survey on the dog park.

Recently, the survey results revealed over 80% of people had a positive or very positive opinion of the dog park.

The city council was practically gushing over the dog park at the meeting, and the only negative feedback that was mentioned at all was 16% of people saying that additional dog park space takes away from other uses of the space for people.

So, the city is now planning to bring the trial off-leash dog park back as a permanent dog park and open up a new temporary off-leash dog park at another park.

Unless they take away a baseball field or something, I have no idea how they'd even fit an off-leash dog park in that particular park. The unbuilt areas of the park are very dense with trees and sometimes varied elevation. I guess I'll just have to wait and see how the dogs destroy it.

I hate how hopeless my fight against dog culture seems to be. And frankly, even attempting to fight it would just make people annoyed with me and actually do me more harm than good."

Last year, my neighbor's small dog attacked my 10 year old. Broke skin and drew blood. They didn't get rid of it until it bit another child a couple weeks later. We have no leash laws or animal control out here and the sheriff did nothing but take a report and see if it had its rabies shot. They replaced the small aggressive dog with 2 HUGE aggressive dogs, Shepherd/lab mix types, 4 dogs total now. They enter my yard, the street, and other neighbors yards. They will chase and try to attack any other small animals, including neighbors dogs while tethered outside. They come and pee and poop in my driveway, 2 nights ago one surprised me in my back yard. We fenced the front yard but any time we go outside they LOSE THEIR MIND, they are not friendly. They are just dying to get ahold of someone or something. My 10 year old can't play outside, ride his bike or to go the mailbox without worrying about getting attacked. Now we have a toddler and I'm afraid to even go outside with her. What do I do besides wait for my child to get mauled? Have spoke to the neighbor MULTIPLE times, they don't care. She's a mother of 4 and when my son got attacked she just let him walk home alone bleeding and crying and then left. They put E collars on a couple of the dogs but they still leave the yard."

I know it's an easy word to read and spell but can't it be something else like duck or dolphin? But noooo… It has to be the same ugly annoying dog everytime!

He said his dogs are equivalent to my children and they're the same level of importance. I was so offended and I can't believe I didn't kick him out of my car right at that moment.

He said he had to keep his ex girlfriend in his life because they coparent their dogs. 💀

I took a look into his back yard once and saw months of shit just built up everywhere even on the concrete.

The final straw was that I'm severely allergic to dogs and no matter how many times I asked him to please not let them sleep next to my head ON THE PILLOW I SLEEP ON he still wouldn't oblige. He said he'd feel bad having them sleep at the foot of the bed or in their dog bed. He also felt bad kicking them out when we had sex but I put my foot down on that one.

I had to take Benedryl every night so I wouldn't have an asthma attack and he would get mad at me for being tired. JUST MOVE THE DOGS.

Finally the sun is out after dreadful months of non stop rain showers and gray skies. You hear the sound of a rare woodpecker and for the first time in years manage to spot it ticking away high up a dead tree. You grab your camera to get a good shot. As you look up not one but two dogs come CHARGIng at you, hairs up, vomiting up a loud high pitched barking series. The wood pecker is now disturbed and out of sight of course. The elderly lady walking them says ""guys stop"" to the dogs in vain after like 5 series of barks. Then the dogs charge up to the next hiker , copy paste repeat. Trying to ignore the events , you walk up to a quiet and beautiful open spot between the trees in the sun. You lie down, meditate , enjoy the sun and sounds of nature. Before long other dogs come and disturb the silence, barking hysterically. By this point you give up getting your peace.

Folks!! I get that we share spaces and it's good that dogs get to in out fresh air instead of being stuck in some apartment. Can't they just let me be in peace and stop the unhinged barking.

To top it all off the sidewalk close to me house is covered in a big turd smudged out by people who have stepped in it.

Sorry for the rant just needed to let this out in a safe space"

Dogs are not allowed in Butte parks, unless specifically permitted (like at the dog park), and most of the trails around here require dogs to be leashed or ""controllable by voice command""... but of course, cult of the K9 members usually disregard those signs.

Anyway, Butte doesn't seem to have it as bad dog-wise as other places I've lived and visited (I was born in MT, but not in Butte, have lived in MT all but 2 years), but it is getting worse, especially post pandemic, like it seems to have just about everywhere.

22,64,petmandu,6,adamacosta,2024-02-29 17:04:38.730359+00:00,A dog's life is more precious than a human life,"I went to my auto insurance office to renegotiate my premium. In the midst of the aimless but semi-compulsory small talk that one has with their insurance rep, I found out that she, her wife, and their four dogs recently moved to my area from out-of-state.

I live in Southwest Florida, which was impacted by the worst hurricane recorded in over a century (Ian) in late 2022. A lot of people in the area (my own parents included) suffered massive losses, including entire homes being demolished and worldly possessions being swept away in 15-ft storm surge flooding while they swam to safety.

The insurance rep remarked at length that she couldn't imagine how people with pets coped in that situation. With a straight face she continued, “If we ever go through a flood, my wife's on her own, ‘cause there's no way I'm NOT saving my fur babies first.”

She then swiveled in her chair and proudly pointed to a framed photo of her “baby”, Kevin, on the desk. Kevin, who was gawping at the camera, tongue lolling and with a crooked Santa hat atop his ears), was apparently her newest 120-lb PUPPY (my eyebrows shot upward while imagining how large of a lumbering beast he would soon become). He was among three other photos of her “children” prominently displayed to her clients, but nowhere could I see a photo of her wife or any other human family members.

Obviously it's devastating for anyone (human or animal) to go through a natural disaster, but until now I had the naive impression that human lives took priority in a life-or-death/serious injury situation. Silly me. At first I thought she was joking, but she made her comment with no hint of irony. Seeing how more and more of these dog nutters speak and behave, I'm scared to think that they would seriously let their spouse or loved one get injured or drown for the sake of a pet."

Well we were just talking and brought up his dog. I just said I am not a dog person. I told him I would 100% always pick people over a dog.

He told me he is tbe opposite. He went on to say stuff like his dog will know him better then any wife or girlfriend ever could.....ewww

He said he would rather have a conversation with his dog. When I brought up how you know dogs don't answer back he went on a rant about how they do with body language and eye contact.

I said I like touch and cuddling. He laughed and said said dogs can provide that.

He made fun of me because I live with my parents. Yes it sucks but I do. I said again how I like having conversations with people.

I told him his dog only loves him because he feeds him. I said stop feeding him and see how long the dog stays with you.

Then he went crazy and was proud that if he dies of a heart attack his dog will eat him.

Why are people sooo crazy."

I wish our government looked into this breed because it seems that all the XL Bully owners are looking into buying a Cane Corso. There was an article about there being a surge in searches for the CC breed."

The thing is that I have one neighbor that has two dogs and the last two times that I have shared the elevator with her, the dogs reek like she hasn't bathed them to the point I've had to breathe through my mouth. If I see her waiting for the elevator, I wait until she's gone to use the elevator. The thing is that she's not on my floor, so last time she got on after I was in, so I couldn't avoid her. I have had other experiences where the person also has strong body odor and while it is also very unpleasant, in this case I think its worse because the dogs cannot bathe themselves. In conclusion, bathe your goddamn dogs for fucks sake!"

Imagine walking around and not having to scan the ground for feces. Not having to worry that a dog is going to jump on you or bite you.

After I am done developing it I will probably never leave the property. Dog nutters are fuct but they are just the tip of the iceberg that is sinking the ship we are all in."

Not sure what happened next door. All of a sudden the 24/7 constantly yapping dogs constantly running in and outside and barking at everything that moves has ended. It has been at least a week. I am guessing one of my fine neighbors really stepped up to the plate, said 'enough', and filed a complaint with the city and the city took action. Maybe there were multiple complaints. This certainly had been in the back of my mind for a while and some preliminary work had been done talking to neighbors about the problem dogs.

In my immediate area, these were the only problem dogs. I am remembering again what peace and quiet is and I do not have my focus ruined or adrenaline jacked up from feeling angry about problem dogs and dog nutters. I am remembering why I moved to this suburban area. I remember commenting to the RE agent years ago: It is so quiet here. I almost forget that this is how a normal neighborhood is supposed to be as it gradually went downhill as dug nutters got more dogs. I am about 90% there believing this, still a part of me worries this will start up again. But guess what? If it does, I will be the next one filing a complaint. Dog nutters are totally capable of keeping their dogs quiet 24/7. Sure, there are occasional dog barks from other areas. There is just none of this constant annoyance, tension, and stress. I can now work at home without feeling continually distracted.

Just posting this as a reminder that there is hope that these nightmare situations can turn around, that dog nutters with constantly barking dogs really can figure out a way to make their multiple dogs shut up and stay quiet, and that at least some communities will take action to put an end to these nightmares."

There was a video online that talked about how a woman was attacked and a stray dog came to her rescue and drove her attacker off. The dog was touted a hero and he was eventually adopted into a loving home. What pissed people off is that the woman that the dog saved didn't adopt the dog herself. They said that how ungrateful she was or how they wished she had died. Even though there are plenty reasons why a person won't adopt a dog such as allergies, living space or financial. A reddit poster was complaining that a group of kids ran to their house to get help as their house was on fire and all they cared about was they weren't able to get the dog out with them (which didn't make it) and wished they would risk their life to go into a burning house and wished they had died instead of the dog. People are hated on for leaving their dogs behind during a disaster like a earthquake, fire or hurricane when time can be the essence and if you have other people you have to worry about or you are literally forced to leave. Heck when people give away their dogs for good reason such as financial or health issues they still face criticism for not doing what they can to keep the dog even if it ends up being detrimental to the person, the people around them and even the dog itself. And there had been a couple of unkind jokes that if a person developed an allergy to dogs, the person should be kicked out or given away first even if it is a little kid. People really take their love for dogs way to far and should stop expecting everyone love dogs as much as they do."

I even notice in my own life that it is more common nowadays to run into a dog somewhere, whether it be the park, hiking, stores, malls...this past year my hatred and anxiety about dogs has skyrocketed, I can barely tolerate dogs. Almost everytime I go hiking or to a park that's not a dog park, there's someone with their dogs and it is so discouraging because I have to worry about the dog barking, or being unleashed and charging after me. And going on here just solidifies for me that I should just stay home because nowhere I go is a safe haven anymore."

Despite this, and despite the amount of people who actually own dogs, I haven't met many people who want to put in this kind of effort for their dogs. My most recent experience has been with my grandfather; he is going through renal failure and has moved in with my parents (and made my mother's life a living hell). Every time I go back home to visit my parents he's letting his dog piss and shit all over the house and refuses to let my mother put a goddamn diaper on the thing because then he'd be ""suffering"". He's almost killed the fucking dog multiple times because he feeds it nothing but human food and one time he fed him grapes... Needless to say we had to rush the poor dog to the emergency vet. The thing lives off of absolutely no exercise and nothing but sausage bites that my grandfather buys from Costco and cuts up for him. Not even regular fucking dog food! Purely human food! The poor thing was so bloated from the sodium he looked like a balloon and he would absolutely chug the water in his bowl and then throw it up. Not to mention the separation anxiety -- when my grandfather goes to his dialysis appointment, the dog howls and shakes and whines to no end. In what way is this a healthy life for this dog that you supposedly ""love more than anything""?

Which is another thing in itself. My mother busts her ass every day trying to work, cook, clean, and care for my ungrateful ass grandfather who treats her like a fucking housemaid. Yet I hear my grandfather baby talk this dog and treat it better than his own child. Absolute fucking insanity. He is always insulting and belittling my mother but that fucking dog is his favorite thing on earth. Talks to it and says shit like, ""You're daddy's baby aren't you?"" I bet he never spoke to my mother that way! Fucking prick.

But this is far from the only experience I've had like this. I've met plenty of friends and family members who straight up don't know how to handle their dogs. As a kid, I got bit in the face by one of my family member's dogs... My longterm ex had three completely untrained dogs, and would get pissed off when the larger breed would destroy his furniture and bark constantly and chew things up. Yeah, no shit, he's a big dog and he gets no exercise, attention, or training! And the list goes on. I'm in college and I've met several people who owned dogs who acted like their bad behaviors were funny or endearing... No, it's actually quite annoying. And you shouldn't be owning a dog when you can hardly take care of yourself or live on your own yet. Ugh.

Tl;dr: dogs aren't expensive toys, treating your dog better than your child is disgusting, and most dog owners are inadequate"

I have seen more than once now when someone posts a dog wandering around and the owner eventually responds.

The owners responses are “she's mine lol 😂” “She's an escape artist and I honestly didn't even know she was missing 🤣” “This is the third time this week haha”.

The person who posted about the dog says “ok, well she's running into the streets and I'm worried about her”.

Turns out the dog is a mile or more away from home and it's a habitual thing.

If your dog is such an escape artist, why are you allowing them outside unsupervised? Why is it funny that your dog is loose and you had no idea?

Just more proof that shows they don't truly care about their dog(s)."

My ""boss"" makes me go to her home regularly to have meetings, but she has a large senior dog and the home smells severely of dog. I can't stand it and it really affects me for weeks after being there and then I get bad anxiety about going back.
I've never known many people with dogs, so I guess I never knew how bad the smell could be until this. This is undoubtedly a damp dog smell that permeates through the house. It hits even from outside the front door. The home is small and generally ""lived-in"", so I think they're either nose blind or just don't care if it smells.
When I get home each time, I immediately put my clothes in the wash, have a shower and wash my hair, then I have to sanitize my personal belongings like phone and laptop - whatever I had with me at the house. I do have contamination OCD, so this probably plays a part in my reaction, but this is extreme even for me. I do it purely because I feel like I can't get the strong dog smell to go away. It also affects my appetite for weeks, because it feels like the smell never leaves my nose and puts me off everything.
I have to go back soon and I'm dreading it! I don't feel comfortable saying anything because it's someone I work for, especially after I've already been going for the last year. I would suggest an alternative location for the meetings, but as it's mostly work-from-home there isn't an actual office.
Plus the boss and I live down the street from each other, so she'd want to know why if I asked to meet somewhere farther away for us both.
I feel crazy for being so affected by this lmao. I keep trying to tell myself it's just a dog, it's just a scent, but I don't understand how they don't realise how bad it smells?!

Edit: Also, no idea if it's psychological, but I always get sick for a couple days immediately after being there - scratchy throat, runny nose, feverish. The air feels so heavy and dusty with the dog smell, I practically suffocate myself trying to hold my breath as long as possible."
36,63,dogs lover,54,farmerjennifer,2024-02-29 17:09:33.551127+00:00,Why do dog owners REFUSE to train their dogs?,"I never realized how bad dog owners can be until my sister adopted one. She literally refuses to train her dog and even gets defensive when other people mention it. Nobody likes her dog, thanks to her I actually started hating dogs. no one visits her anymore. Whenever I'm at her place I have to push the dog away and ignore it or unfortunately yell at it, because my sister doesn't do anything other than watch me struggle with her nervous dog. sometimes she even laughs at us.

Shortly after the adoption I discovered this subreddit and realized that almost ALL dog owners are the same. They KNOW what they're getting into, a dog causes nothing but stress in their lives (I also noticed that none of them really are happy), they know how much time they have to sacrifice, but for some reason they still constantly talk about how much they love their annoying dogs, while absolutely not caring about training them properly.

I don't get it. How can such a life (for the owner AND the dog) be fulfilling? How can they not see the absurdity of owning a dog? like, just 50 years ago or something, most dogs had specific ""jobs"", each dog breed had a purpose, most of them were never meant to live in tiny apartments and walk for 1-2 hours a day. How stupid and ignorant do dog owners have to be to not see this? It's not even my ""hateful"" opinion, it's just a fact. Most dogs were never meant to be pets."

Her partner of course sided with the MIL because ‘pets are family'. She was then accused of being insensitive when she refused.

As a woman who gave birth a few months ago I could not think of anything worse! In fact, I've found myself disliking dogs more since having my baby. These creatures are just so unhygienic and unpredictable and a hospital is no place for them, especially at such a vulnerable time. The dog would do nothing but get in the way and be a nuisance.

I'm sure the hospital wouldn't allow this anyway but I just find it crazy that these people would even suggest a dog be present in the first place."

We were in a very upper-middle class, ""cool"" part of town (Newport Beach, California,) mind you, where dog-nuttery is at its peak around here.

When we walked in, I saw a young 20 something girl sitting down waiting for her coffee, and at her feet, was a huge ugly looking dog, it appeared to have the face of a pitbull and the body of an english bulldog. She had dressed it up with a tutu and some beaded Mardi Gras necklaces, and it looked miserable. It sat there drooling, and by the time she picked up her coffee, it had left a HUGE puddle of drool over a foot wide, on the floor. She never asked for any paper towels to clean it up. She just got up and left. Another customer came in, wearing really nice shoes, and stepped on the drool. The workers saw and did nothing. He kind of jokingly laughed it off, but I could not believe my eyes. Needless to say, won't be going there again.

In one ear and out! I flat out told her no. Not that I was sorry, not 'maybe another time,' just NO.

And wow thank you all so much for the comments. I feel so much better knowing I'm not an asshole/cold hearted and this is indeed excessive. I agree with the general opinion (thus far). Friend is struggling to cope and is doing so in an extreme way. I think from now on when something dog related is randomly thrown into the middle of a conversation I'm going to respond with good news about the entrepreneurial endeavor I am undertaking. Stupid dog video? ""Hey, look at my milestone!""

Using a throwaway so I'm not found.

I (30F) enjoy dogs from a distance, at times, and in small doses. I don't want one, my very close friend (35F) knows this.

My very close friend doesn't want kids, and loves animals instead. She had five dogs and one recently died around Halloween. It was her favorite dog. She'd had her the longest and it was sad how she died. I was even sad for her. For like a month she moped around, saying how it was the worst year she'd ever had because of that, and I didn't want to be insensitive but like...there's war going on. It could be worse.

Still, I didn't say anything and let her vent countless times, because that's what friends do. Fast forward and now, she just got another dog like a month ago. She's training her, getting her acclimated to their house, disciplines her, etc. so she does spend a lot of time with the dog. I will say she's a good owner.

But, she will not stop talking about the damn dog. It is the ONLY thing she talks about. Dear God.

We were supposed to do dinner at her house last night, and we literally didn't eat. She just wanted to play fetch all night and when it got late she was like eh, I'm not really feeling like cooking. I left early and got a burger on the way back home.

I am also personally undertaking a pretty big entrepreneurial endeavor right now and oftentimes, I'm wiped by the end of the day. I just want to shower, do my chores, look at some memes, and chill out. For me to cut time out of my day to drive over, expecting dinner, only to...play fetch? I was pissed.

She also bombards me with videos, and pictures, and multiple texts all about the dog. Never asks how I'm doing, what I did that day, how's my business coming along...it's all about the dog.

And she gets into TMI territory. Like she told me about (I don't even want to say it) something to do with its anus when I was eating. I said nope, I'm eating, nope, but she kept on. And she tries to go on like in an educational way but like I don't fucking care lol. She knows I don't want a dog so why do I need to know? That would be like me telling her about breastfeeding pumps knowing she has no interest in having kids.

The texts etc. also come in all throughout the day. By the time I check my phone eventually (I typically keep it on do not disturb/work mode for the day) there are always multiple pics and videos and idk what to say other than 'oh wow' in response to all of them lol like I just don't know what to say.

It's literally also just flat out the last fucking thing I want to hear about after I've been staring at the computer for 10 hours.

I can steer the conversation to another direction and then boom, dog pics for no reason. Dog videos. I just don't have anything to add to the conversation at that point other than 'oh wow' or 'oh cute.'

And if it's not the dog, it's going down memory lane to talk about the dead dog. Like my phone will just randomly get showered with pics of the old dog dying at like the dog hospital. It's very jarring and I do not know wtf to say. She also will do similar things in regard to animals at the shelter she sees on TikTok/Instagram. Idk what to say. It's sad but I don't want to adopt the animals?

Anyway, if I say, ""hey, I don't want to talk about your dog/your old dog/shelter dogs all the time"" I'm going to sound like a colossal asshole. She loves animals so much. The dog that died really left a hole in her heart that I will never understand and this new one makes her so happy in a way I will also never understand. But she's my closest friend. I have no idea how to tell her to stop sending me fucking dog pictures without sounding like a total dick. Help.

TLDR: Closest friend's favorite dog died, left huge hole in her heart, even though she has four others. She got a new favorite dog after the new year, loves it, is so so happy, but dear GOD it's the only thing she ever talks about. If I'm ever talking about something in my life, like a big work project, she'll just respond with dog pics. All conversations turn to the dog, and sometimes uncomfortable/TMI things having to do with sick/dying/dead dogs/dog anuses. I'm beyond annoyed and need her to cut back but idk how to do it without sounding like a huge dick. The dog (and the dead one) mean SO much to her but like, I'm just not a dog person and don't want to talk about dogs 24/7."

I tried walking her on a leash but that's not possible because the stray dogs near my house keep coming after her to play. But she gets scared and doesn't walk.

Then, I fixed up my balcony so she can spend time there. But she doesn't like it much. Even tried growling and biting me when I tried letting her out there.

I'm at a complete loss. She seems really unhappy at times at home and has become very restless. I play with her and she has plenty of toys. When I'm playing with her or she's playing in general, she's fine. But she doesn't purr at all anymore and doesn't look very happy about the arrangement.

What can I do to make her happy and back to purring again without having to compromise her wellbeing?"

My partner (we don't live together yet) has fostered a kitten for a short time and has raised the idea of keeping it. We are likely to live together soon.

I have many concerns about having an animal given my work lifestyle, the financial impact and other factors. I'm able to articulate the cons (hair everywhere, vomiting, scratching, etc), but I want to really understand what a cat would add to my life in practical terms rather than just the generic benefits of a cat (for example, I've found articles saying that cats are low maintenance - the current scenario is no pet and zero maintenance so that doesn't matter to me). Would really value everyone's thoughts.

Beyond a lot of questionable practices like once providing 'final respects' coverage if your pet dies to a covered illness. They would pay for the urn and cremation. This was a huge marketing scheme they presented to me in 2015. In 2017, they decided to no longer extend this type of coverage and sent an email notification. I never got that email and most importantly it was not outlined in my renewal. I didnt realize it was gone until I tried to use it last October when we lost a dog that had been insured with embrace for 8.5 years. Thanks embrace, that was a low blow.

But the main reason I am writing this is embrace just doubled my monthly cost. For two dogs I went from $150 per month to $298 per month. This is for a 6yr and 9yr old dog. Shiba Inu's live 16 years, so these two are not old for their breed. I called them last night and they told me that they adjust prices for inflation, cost of services, dog breed, etc. Okay, sounds fine.

To see what was going on, I did a quote on embrace's website. I compared with my exact coverages, added a year to my dogs' age (because why not), and it came in at $183/mo. Thats only a $33/mo increase for inflation, my location, cost of services, and age. Honestly, that seems completely fair. But I couldnt figure out where the remaining $117 per month increase was coming from.

I spoke to embrace's manager and asked why a new quote would be that much cheaper than mine. I was told since my dogs have been with them so long [known to them as “tenure”], they are going to be on the hook for paying things they could otherwise deny/exclude for new customers (cancer, diseases, injuries). So, they not only raise the rate for how old the dog is, but they are also raising the rate because they can't otherwise deny a potential claim on my policy from said age. Well that seems illegal.

How many ways are these guys trying to double dip rating factors in order to ""manage risk"". Honestly, this seems more greed driven than anything. They lean heavily on a half developed AI claim processing system instead of hiring an adequate staff. They also do not cover a lot of things under their illness plans that other major pet insurance companies do. With embrace you pay a lot more, for less."

Does it also depend on what breed of cat? Are there breeds like dog breeds, that are just always friendly if brought up in a loving home? Like golden retrievers for example. Is there a golden retriever equivalent type of cat breed?

An example of a loving cat to me is the cat named Blue from the MimiBlueOsa youtube channel. The grey, white one with blue eyes. I would be really happy if I had a cat like that lol.

Advice?,"What appears to be a 6-8month old kitten appeared at our door a week or two ago now. She has been around our complex for a bit, but I'm pretty sure she's a stray because we spotted an adult cat with her a few times and a second kitten. We are trying to catch them all to spay/neuter and release, but it's been difficult as the others are skidish and older. The one that ran into our apartment has done so multiple times now, and last night mid rain storm she ran in and we noticed she's in heat. We took the chance to take care of her some and plan on getting her to the shelter ASAP when they open.

Any advice? Would it be bad to keep her? She's incredibly social and not spraying, but it could just be while she's in heat. Assuming she isn't a pet somehow, is this a bad idea or does anyone have advice on how to properly take care of this situation to get these cats the best care they can get. I just want to keep them safe and happy!

He recently had a urinary crystal flair up and had to take a couple trips to the vet over the last two weeks. It's all under control now but almost nightly he pees in my bed, generally on top of the covers/us. I know it's not a uti because of all the recent vet visits/checks, so it's most likely behavioral.

The little love is on fluoxetine for his anxiety and I have been giving him gabapentin since the crystal issue as I don't want a resurgence. He's also on a medicated diet for his urinary issues (mainly the wet food but I do also have the dry kind and leave it out for him too)

Everything I've done so far to negate the issue:

new litter box in a new part of the apartment

treats every time I see him using the litter box

cleaning all the bedding with an enzymatic cleaner before washing with detergent and vinegar

playing and cuddling before bed

covering my mattress in a non-absorbing cover while I'm gone

scooping and changing the litter a few times a day to keep clean and empty

I'm going to pick up a new type of litter today (heard good things about the walnut litter) and also a Feliway diffuser (very mixed reviews but I'll try anything)

I genuinely don't know what else to do. I'm so exhausted and stressed about the whole situation that it's come to the point where I've even considered rehoming my sweet boy but I don't think I could handle that emotionally.

Also of note, I can not lock him out of the room with the bed because I live in a 370sq ft studio apartment and all of it is just one room and a tiny bathroom.

I desperately need guidance if there's something I've missed, I just want my sweet boy back on track and I will absolutely try anything"

(r/CatAdvice removed this post for reasons unknown. I must have violated an arbitrary posting rule. Please don't do that to this one too. I'm desperate and I need help now)

I'm a monster. I suck. I'm no good as a human being. I know ALL of this. Call me whatever you want, it's nothing I either don't know it haven't repeatedly told myself I am.

I wanna preface all this by telling you a bit about myself and my situation . What I'm saying is I am having a very very very hard time in my life right now. I'm severely disabled and my disease is degenerative. I'm losing my ability to walk and can barely stand. Last night I was relieved of ALL my money by another evil person and don't know how ill make it through this month without it (i only get it at the end if the end of the month through SSDI). I have so so SO much anger and resentment towards the world because of my childhood and adolescence. And yes I've tried therapy. Lots of it. I can't afford it anymore. So please understand this is the context of where I'm at and maybe the following post will make more sense.

I live alone and don't have an SO and have 2 friends. About a year and a half ago, I had an AMAZING cat. He was a little cuddlebug, endearingly mischievous, and followed me everywhere I went in the home. Hed sleep right square on my head all the time. Amazing cat.

And I lost him. He's gone and it still makes me so sad. His name was Groot and I'll miss him forever.

So finally, after all this time of morning him and missing him and just being heartbroken over the fact that I don't have him around anymore, I finally decided it was time and I was ready to get a new cat. What he did help alleviate my loneliness was huge and he helped me with my mental health so much I decided I wanted another little fur baby to try to do the same. So I adopted a cat. I picked her out because at the shelter she had to sign in her cage and said she had wonky hips that affected her gait. My gait is messed up as well and I thought ""what kindred spirits we will be"" ! So I chose her. She wasn't super sociable in the interaction room at the shelter, but she also didn't resist being picked up by the shelter employees to bring to me (cuz I can't carry her myself because of my mobility issues), and she didn't try to run or anything it didn't resist being petted she just didn't really respond to being petted either just kind of sat there. I figured it was just nervousness for being in the shelter. She also had apparently had puncture wounds on her rump showing something and bit her when she was picked up by animal control. So something bad happened to her and I felt horrible about it for her and I wanted to give her a safe home.

I did give her a safe home. I gave her all the space in the world, she has literally the entire living room to herself as ""her room"". Places to climb, the cat tree, high places she can go to feel safe, little cubbies I made and little crevices I made for her to go and snuggle up into and hide. Toys. I got a feliway diffuser. I got calming treats. I got a probiotic supplement made by Purina that's supposed to help with anxiety in cats over time. And again, I've given her plenty of space and haven't tried to force interaction at all. I know they need time to adjust to new homes.

But it's been 5 months. She will not go anywhere near me, one time she was hiding in my closet in my bedroom and I went into the bedroom so that's where I hang out and do my thing and play Playstation and stuff. So scared of me is she that she refused to leave the closet to walk past me to get out of the room which she would have had to do. Shit in the closet because she refused to come out and pass me. WAS LAYING IN IT. a cat laying in its own waste. That's a scared cat. Cats don't do that.

I tried to take her to the vet. I tried to pick her up with a towel gently softly talking to her quietly as I did. Nope she ran away as soon as I made a move to grab the towel around her. Again I have a severe disability it's very hard for me to stand on my own so chasing her and picking her up or doing anything like that was difficult, finally almost got my hands on her to pick her up and she swung around and bit me hard on my hand. HARD. Blood poured down from it immediately and was covering my whole hand. I lost it I screamed at her. I didn't hit her or make any physical contact with her at all So I'm not able to take her to the vet without somebody helping me round her up and wrangle her. Which if there's an emergency of course I would do what we find a way to get her rounded up. But getting her for a routine checkup or anxiety treatment. It is just something I'm not all that able to do without help and I can tell it would be a shit show.

So since then I've again given her plenty of space and left her alone pretty much ignored her to let her come to me on her own time. But she has this really annoying shitty habit: she ripped into my bread bags and eat the bread, just a tiny little bit of it but leave of course the bag open and ripped up so it goes stale and goes bad within hours and the bag is ruined. She's not starving, I feed her three times a day. In fact last night before I went to bed I fed her. I woke up this morning and went into the kitchen for breakfast.... And for the fourth time now, there was the bag of bread on the floor ripped open. I have issues of memory so I forgot to put it away last night and hide it in the cabinet (this is what I've had to do because of what she does to bread. )

For this next part, I just want to remind you all that last night I was parted from all my money by an evil manipulative exploitative person (that story's irrelevant to this post). I've not been in a good headspace since then, I'm still not. Well I saw the bread ripped open and on the floor next to her bowl of food which had had a huge meal in there last night for her which she ate. Well, I snapped. I started screaming obscenities directed her. I took the bag of bread and whipped it up on top of the cabinet where she hides , don't know if it hit or not cuz I can't see up there. I started screaming that I hate her. I started screaming ""you want to be fucking scared of me you worthless excuse for a pet?"" and I took my broom and used to herd her off the cabinet . Of course she went running off the top, I just screamed and screamed and screamed ""I fucking hate you"" and""l "" be fucking scared of me you worthless fucking thing"". I never chased her really, except just took a few steps to lean forward to direct the sound towards her more, but she was darting around the room running almost bouncing off of the walls doing parkour trying to scramble up the screens to get into a higher cabinet, she was scared. Because of course she was. I was screaming at the top of my lungs at her. Never hit or made physical contact with her, again. But all that anger and all this pain and everything that I'm dealing with came out in this frustration that I've had with how much she's just refused to have anything to do with me while my previous cat was so loving and so attached to me. After 6 months of everything I described above she was still refusing to go near me and all that came out today in this incident. I went in my room buried my head and my hands and sobbed. I want to fucking die bc I don't deserve to live.

Again you can call me anything you want. I already know it's true, and I've already called myself it over and over again. This was literally less than 30 minutes ago and Im still not sure if I'm not just going to overdose on my meds and be done with this shitty infuriating frustrating life I've had and continue to have.

Please help me. I can barely see the screen of the phone right now because my eyes are full of tears. I'm a monster for doing that to her and she'll never like me now. Obviously I need to give her a new home but I know she'll be fucked up no matter what from this, and being sent to the shelter a second time and being uprooted from her familiar environment will fuck her up too. So I basically ruined this cat's life just like fucked up people have ruined mine by what happened to me growing up.

Please somebody help me."

We do not want to have to rehome them at all.

Being as selling and buying a house takes time, we have found it incredibly difficult to find a temporary place in between. The apartments available that allow pets are either beyond our price range or uncomfortably small. Our family and friends aren't able to care of them while we are in the process of moving and buying a new place.

Is there such a thing as an in between care taker? Like a foster but not foster home for pets? We want to keep them but we want them taken care of in the in between. What are some legal things I should look out for. I'd be devastated if I put them into someone's care for short term and then taken away from me.

This is with medical intervention.

So the main issues here are pet dander and litter dust. It's getting to the point where it is severely impacting my daily function. Right now the two cats can go anywhere they want in the house, including the bedrooms. But this is starting to be unsustainable. Due to my condition, cleanliness is now a must. And it's an uphill battle to maintain a hypoallergenic low-dust/dander environment with 2 cats around.

I've tried different litter types. Absolute no's include clay, silica, corn, and pine pellets (sawdust is still dust). I liked tofu litter but it was very pricey and still involved powdery particulates. Currently using walnut litter but dust is still an issue. Basically, I've come to the conclusion that all litters involve dust that track through my home.

The pet dander is another thing. It had become really overwhelming for me as a severe asthmatic to try and keep up with daily vacuuming, mopping, etc of such a large space.

I already have HEPA vacuums, air purifiers, N95 masks (while cleaning), roomba (they actually worsen my breathing)… I brush the cats daily. I'm at my wits end.

What if I keep my two cats isolated to the master bedroom and connect that to an outdoor catio, so that the rest of the house can be more livable for me? I will enrich that space and still play with them daily.

Alternatively, what if I transition the two cats from fully indoor to outdoor w access to garage?

This is a last resort, but I've also considered rehoming my cats. Problem is, they are pandemic fur babies that are very bonded to me since they were 4 weeks old. Both will scream nonstop if they don't see me for hours. I've had them stay with a friend for a few days while I traveled before and they absolutely terrorized her and her roommates with nonstop screams, knocking over plants and small furniture, etc. they are very good loving cats, just very needy.

I'm also very attached to my cats so I obviously would prefer not to rehome them.

Would it be crueler to rehome them or to have them live in the biggest bedroom of the house with daily extensive play w me? I would prefer not to expose them to outdoors but I haven't fully ruled out that option either."

Unfortunately my cat has recently had an ultrasound after showing some signs of dehydration and lethargy and it came back with a mass in his stomach and also on his kidneys. He's an orange cat and almost 14.

The vet let us know he roughly may have 60 days and it appears to be lymphoma. We understand we have to make a decision and do not plan to drag it on too long but as of now he's still seemingly very lively (recently bounced back from the lethargy mentioned previously) and is ultimately looking like a normal cat still with purring, cleaning etc. and begging for food as usual.

Our issue is that it is extremely hard for him to keep the food down. Our vet mentioned this is almost certainly due to the mass in his stomach. We completely cut out dry and doing wet only but even after blending the wet down to almost a liquid it still seems later on in the night he brings it back up as if it's not even getting to the digestion phase.

We don't want our cat to suffer but as he's still appearing so normal (aside from the vomiting). it's extremely hard to know what to do. I don't want him to be starving and we just can't notice an underlying pain. Is it possible any food is still getting through to him? Are there other alternatives that don't require special in clinic treatments that we haven't thought of? Please help with any advice you may have here. If we can have some more time with him as he's still able to cuddle with us and move around that's all we want here before it's time to bring him in.

TLDR: Cat has a stomach mass that seemingly isn't able to help him keep food down(even puree). Doesn't have much more time due to stage of cancer but is there any other options to help him with food ingestion so we know he isn't starving from the vomiting. He's still very lively and doesn't show any current signs of external pain yet. Thank you everyone"

My dog (11 yo M mongrel) got diagnosed with ringworm today. We got prescribed some tablets and anti-fungal cream. He eats tablets no problem, but when I try to apply the cream on him, he gets super angry and tries to bite. He is generally not an aggressive dog, but he's really not feeling well now (still sore after recent ALS surgery, his tummy also hurts, he has a slight fever and he's feeling all itchy because of the infection, of course he's not in the best mood, and now hooman tries to put unknown substance on top of all that misery?! Scandalous!). He will only bite you (without puncturing skin) if you ignore him growling and frowning, and keep doing whatever you doing that makes him mad. Which I have to do, unfortunately! :(((

We've put the cone of shame on him (he's pretty chill about the cone), I was in front of him with treats and talking to him nice and excited, while my sister sat next to him and tried to apply the cream on his side. He only didn't bite me because I moved my hand away quicker, then he went to snap at my sister.

We've tried pretending that we're just petting him (which he normally loves, he's a cuddly baby), but he was already suspicious and whenever he felt the cream touch his skin, he'd throw his head side to side, turning into that insanely angry, trying-to-bite-you ball of madness.

I don't want to lose his trust, we've left him for now, he's just chilling with one of his toys.

I don't know what to do, he has so many bumps and spots that first need to get washed with hibiscrub, then get the cream on it, but he just won't let us do any of that :( They're on his back, sides, paws, belly and close to the base of his tail. That's a lot of spots to cover!

Any advices? Plz help"

Both of my dogs developed mouth tumors two years apart. Are mouth tumors that common or should I be concerned about environmental factors at my home?

First was my English bulldog who I put down two years ago once his tumor caused quality of life to deteriorate. He did have several health issues through this life, so, I was not surprised to discover yet another health problem for my poor bulldog.

Then, my lab mix just got diagnosed with Squamous Cell Carcinoma. She is 7 and has been the healthiest dog I've ever had (literally not a single issue until now).

I find it hard to believe that both dogs developing mouth tumors over two years is just a coincidence. I have two young kids and another pet which has me really worried.

We adopted this sweet boy, Chester, back in September. He's a 100 pound 5 year old lab/shepherd/something mix and he's an old soul. He's pretty lazy but he's a good boy. He has slept in the bed with us since day one because that's what his previous owner did (she was elderly and had to go into assisted living, that's why we adopted him) and our hearts hurt for him because he didn't understand what was going on. Fast forward to now, my husband and I both sleep HORRIBLY because he is either under or on either of our feet and legs at any given point in the night. He will not sleep parallel to us in the middle, he has to be stretched out on the foot of the bed or curled up. Getting him to move is like pulling teeth, I think he pretends not to hear us. It eventually leads to me kicking or firmly nudging him to move but he just goes on my husband's side and it's a vicious circle all dang night.

-He is crate trained but his crate does not fit in our room and is out in the living room. -We have tried putting his bed in our room on the floor but that was never going to work lol -Sometimes after being kicked out of bed by one of us in our sleep, he will get off the bed and go to my husband's side and whine at him (which usually results in Chester giving up and getting back on the bed to fall asleep)

And a big part of me feels bad because that's all he's known, sleeping on the human bed. Also please don't give me the “dogs aren't here forever, let them sleep with you” stuff, because I am sleep deprived because of a dog. We love him. We need a solution!"

This probably going to be a long post and I do apologise for grammar errors, but I'll try to explain everything. For the part that 'we should find another vet' is not really easy, because in my country (Hungary) there is not a lot of good vets.

Species: Cat

Age: 5

Sex/Neuter status: Female

Breed: British Shorthair

Body weight: ~4.5 KG

History:

So, my SO and I have a 5 years old british short hair cat, 3 years ago she was diagnosed with IBD, she vomitted a lot, not even water remined in her (there was X-Ray and Ultrasound examination back then, from these the vet thought this will be IBD). She is an indoor cat, there no other pet in the house.

The vet then gave her steroid injections which stopped the constant vomitting and it seemed that we calmed down IBD (yes, I know IBD symptoms can come and go). Fast forward to last year's november 6th when we noticed her left eye part where the tears can come out got swollen a bit. We went to vet and the after the vet checked her he tought this will be some kind of ear infection.

We started treating her with eye drops and a product called Orilan (ear drops), it didn't work, her ears are itchy, then we started (recommended by the vet - this can be applied to anything from here) to treat her with OtoAct drops, it helped her but for just a few days, next we started the treat her with OtoMax, it started to treat the symptom a little bit. The vet also took samples from her ear and sent it to testing. The test showed that there is some kind of fungus in her hear so OtoMax and OtoAct treatment was continued.

Fast forward to 2024 Feb. 10th when we vent to the vet for a quick check about her ears and during the examination she started to vomit. The vet gave her 3 kind of injection (something to the vomit, something b12 vitamin and something else too.) It didn't do the trick so the vet recommended we should do an ultrasound test, we did and it didn't show any kind of problem, not even IBD symptoms apart from the vomitting.

So as of today, we still have the ear problem, another test was done a few weeks ago, she still has some fungus in her ears and also the vomitting. The vet recommended we should give her Florentero pills (probiotics) and Quamatel Mini. It sems the Quamatel Mini can hold back the vomitting, but after we stop it, the vomitting comes back. And a strange thing that sometimes a vomit comes after the cat goes to take a poop.

Currently she gets 2 kinds of food:

Hill's Prescription Diet Feline Gastrointestinal Biome - Chicken - dry food - daily Hill's Prescription Diet Gastrointestinal Biome - Chicken - wet food - once or twice a week She drinks a good amount of water daily, she has a Xiaomi water fountain, cleaned weekly as thoroughly as we can She also gets 3 type of Gimcat paste: GimCat Malt-Soft Extra Paste (for against hairballs); GimCat Multi-Vitamin-Extra; and recently we bought GimCat Gastro Intestinal paste, we gave her these pastes daily (not all, but one of each) Others than these, she gets nothing.

Also she has a strange behaviour, it usually happens during early nights after she wakes up, she licks her own furniture.

My SO and I thought maybe she has some kind of food allergy and maybe we should try the Royal Canin hypoallergen dry food.

What do you think? Did anyone has the same problem? Should we change her food? She we do a poop test?"

I'm asking for feedback on his chances of getting through this, could this be CKD even though he showed no prior symptoms? Or are the causes of this more likely to be environmental?

He is a sweet boy but has never got along with the other 3 cats in the home (that came before him). Over the last year, he has become more aggressive, isolated, and a jerk. He is fighting with the other cats, he sits in the middle of the cat room, in front of the food, and lays in front of the litter boxes and prevents others from eating or doing their business. It has now escalated to the point he is intentionally peeing on EVERYTHING. I caught him on our indoor ring camera going into the cat room and sniffing the litter box and then going to pee/poop on the cat bed. He is peeing on clothes, pooping in corners, etc. We have tried wall plug ins (per vet recommendation), isolating him, etc. Nothing is working. My house stinks and is flaring up my asthma from him peeing everywhere. I have had my other cats for years and they do not fight with each other, never pee outside the litter box, etc. The litter is always clean, he has unlimited water, plenty of food, toys/pets/love, etc but he just keeps ruining beds, couches, the floor, and I am losing my mind!

I am miserable, my husband is miserable, and our other cats are miserable. I feel awful by planning to surrender him but I am not sure what to do at this point. Should I find a no-kill shelter? Where I adopted him from is a kill shelter but their paperwork says if we need to surrender than just give him back and pay the $25 surrender fee but I don't want him killed. I want him to find a new home, maybe as a single cat, and be happy there."

I adopted a kitty when he was 12 weeks old. He was rescued at 5 weeks so grew up without a mom or siblings. He was super cute for about 4 weeks. Then his playtime aggression surfaced. I've spent a lot of time working from home so he had all the attention. I played with him regularly. Sought advice from a behaviorist as well. I know how to and how not to play with him but in the past few weeks I feel like I have to lock myself in the bedroom if I wanted peace. It feels like there's not enough time in the day as he could play all day. Apart from the painful marks he's left on me, I feel like he's been leaving an even bigger mark on my life. We don't sleep together but as soon as he hears me waking up he starts crying. I can't have a peaceful morning just cuddling because he's literally mauling me. I am eating breakfast with one hand and entertaining him with the other. Can't even hang the washing in a room because he would make the rack collapse. I am not doing the things I used to do for my mental health before (yoga, meditation, journaling). Furthermore, that's a given but I feel like he took control over my life.

I love him, he can be cute but the good moments won't outweigh the bad as I am constantly under stress and I feel it's not good.

I love him because he's a little companion and I feel very guilty at the thought of rehoming him. I took responsibility when I adopted him and it saddens me that likely I will need to let him go.

I'm not sure what exactly this means, I'm hoping/assuming it is any animal which can be ethically kept as a pet while living in a cage the majority of the time.

I wondered if there are any (ethically) “caged pets”?

I don't have access to a grassy garden but have a fair bit of indoor space for “cage”, as well as patio if needed.

I'd rather not rescue a hamster (again), they aren't the best fit for my anxiety due to their inability to show clear signs of sickness and stubborn love of hiding in walls/permanent fixtures. I love them, but the moment you relax they're gone.

Thanks for any feedback."
88,63,dogs lover,329,cheryldaniel,2024-02-29 17:30:49.925274+00:00,Why are dog owners so sensitive?,"Guy I was talking to kept referring to his dog as “his lady”. Example “I have my lady trained not to bite, except when you rub her tummy too long!” “My lady sleeps at the foot of my bed” when I asked why he was calling his dog that and if she has a name, he became extremely aggro and started making personal attacks. To make it worse he was triple texting / spamming photos of his dog without me saying anything for the first half of our conversation. So. Why are dog owners so sensitive?"
89,63,dogs lover,244,tara46,2024-02-29 17:31:18.785730+00:00,A dog's life is more precious than a human life,"I went to my auto insurance office to renegotiate my premium. In the midst of the aimless but semi-compulsory small talk that one has with their insurance rep, I found out that she, her wife, and their four dogs recently moved to my area from out-of-state.

I live in Southwest Florida, which was impacted by the worst hurricane recorded in over a century (Ian) in late 2022. A lot of people in the area (my own parents included) suffered massive losses, including entire homes being demolished and worldly possessions being swept away in 15-ft storm surge flooding while they swam to safety.

The insurance rep remarked at length that she couldn't imagine how people with pets coped in that situation. With a straight face she continued, “If we ever go through a flood, my wife's on her own, ‘cause there's no way I'm NOT saving my fur babies first.”

She then swiveled in her chair and proudly pointed to a framed photo of her “baby”, Kevin, on the desk. Kevin, who was gawping at the camera, tongue lolling and with a crooked Santa hat atop his ears), was apparently her newest 120-lb PUPPY (my eyebrows shot upward while imagining how large of a lumbering beast he would soon become). He was among three other photos of her “children” prominently displayed to her clients, but nowhere could I see a photo of her wife or any other human family members.

Obviously it's devastating for anyone (human or animal) to go through a natural disaster, but until now I had the naive impression that human lives took priority in a life-or-death/serious injury situation. Silly me. At first I thought she was joking, but she made her comment with no hint of irony. Seeing how more and more of these dog nutters speak and behave, I'm scared to think that they would seriously let their spouse or loved one get injured or drown for the sake of a pet."
90,63,dogs lover,166,lisa60,2024-02-29 17:31:54.928259+00:00,Tried dating a guy with a dog (cautionary tale),"Alright so. Ill spare you the deets and give you cliff notes. He had his dog tattooed on his chest. That threw me for a loop but then we kept talking and getting closer. I really liked him by the time he invited me over to his place vs. in public. His dog and foster dog had shit on the floor in his home despite there being a dog door and he picked it up and threw it away like it was normal. I pretended I didn't notice to not embarrass him. As time went on I began to like him less and these things started to disgust me more.

He said his dogs are equivalent to my children and they're the same level of importance. I was so offended and I can't believe I didn't kick him out of my car right at that moment.

He said he had to keep his ex girlfriend in his life because they coparent their dogs. 💀

I took a look into his back yard once and saw months of shit just built up everywhere even on the concrete.

The final straw was that I'm severely allergic to dogs and no matter how many times I asked him to please not let them sleep next to my head ON THE PILLOW I SLEEP ON he still wouldn't oblige. He said he'd feel bad having them sleep at the foot of the bed or in their dog bed. He also felt bad kicking them out when we had sex but I put my foot down on that one.

I had to take Benedryl every night so I wouldn't have an asthma attack and he would get mad at me for being tired. JUST MOVE THE DOGS.

Anyways, glad that's over. I won't get desperate and do that again."
